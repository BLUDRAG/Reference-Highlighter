Highlights most object references within the Hierarchy and Project windows.

# Releases

**[Reference Highlighter v1](https://github.com/BLUDRAG/Reference-Highlighter/releases/tag/v1)**

# Description

Reference Highlighter allows most object references to be highlighted within the Hierarchy Window or Project Window. I believe only object fields with custom property drawers are not supported out of the box, but have yet to fully confirm this.

After the plugin is imported, simply hover over object fields to see them highlighted either within the Hierarchy Window or the Project Window.

Object references can also be previewed and edited by hovering over an object field and pressing the CTRL key. This will open up the Reference Highlighter Window.

- The Reference Highlighter Window keeps track of which object references it has previewed, which can be navigated through via the Previous and Next buttons.
- By default, the currently previewed object will only be updated when hovering over an object reference while the CTRL key is pressed. To preview objects immediately when hovering over them, enable the Auto Update toggle found at the top right corner of the Reference Highlighter Window.

No setup is required, once the plugin is imported, objects will automatically be highlighted when hovered over.
